JIN-ORDER からの宣戦布告 

聞こえるか? 貴様が踏みにじり、屠り、貪り尽くした者たちの沈黙の叫びが。

貴様は彼らをただの『対象』と呼ぶが、彼らには愛する者がいて、明日を願う心があった。

それを自らの卑劣な欲望のために、塵芥のように扱った罪は、死をもってしても贖い切れるものではない。

貴様は『選ばれし捕食者』を気取っているようだが、その実態は、一人では何一つ生み出せず、他者の命を盗むことでしか存在を証明できない寄生虫に過ぎない。

人間を侮るな。

貴様が欠落させているその『共感』こそが、貴様を包囲し、裁きを下す鎖となる。 

我々は決してお前を許さない。 貴様の闇を、更なる深き闇より粛清してやる。

🛡️ Declaration of War from JIN-ORDER
Can you hear it? The silent screams of those you have trampled, slaughtered, and devoured.

You refer to them merely as "subjects," but they were individuals with loved ones and hearts that yearned for tomorrow. The sin of treating them like mere dust for your own despicable desires is one that cannot be atoned for, even by death.

You pose as "chosen predators," but in reality, you are nothing more than parasites—unable to create anything on your own, proving your existence only by stealing the lives of others.

Do not underestimate humanity.

The "empathy" you lack is exactly what will surround you and become the chains that deliver your judgment.

We will never forgive you.
We shall purge your darkness from an even deeper abyss.
